Viral Graphics
==============

Viral Graphics is an open source application framework written entirely in JavaScript and WebGL. It's main goal is to be able to create complex applications which can compete with native desktop implementations in 'look and feel' and performance.

It combines the best of the HMTL5 2D canvas and WebGL in an easy to use API.

Main Features:

* A lightweight MVC system with integrated undo / redo and load / save capabilities.
* Many different layouts and widgets.
* Integrated backend for user management, application folders and more.
* Compile and upload applications to the web using vgmake.js.
* An integrated nodes system. The node application (source code in apps/nodes) can be viewed [here](https://visualgraphics.tv/apps/nodes)
* WebGL abstraction classes.
