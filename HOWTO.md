HowTo
=====
 
For detailed descriptions how to write, test and publish Visual Graphics applications using VIDE and VGMAKE please see the DEVELOP section on the Visual Graphics Homepage at www.visualgraphics.tv

VIDE
====

VIDE, the integrated development environment, is provided in the apps folder for local execution inside a Web Browser. You can download native Desktop versions of it on the Website or in the Download Menu of VIDE itself.

VGMAKE
======

Desktop Versions of VGMAKE can be downloaded on the Website. It does not make sense to provide a Browser based version in this Repository as it could not access local files for compilation.
