Examples
========

This directory contains some easy examples how to use Visual Graphics. The source code of each application is inside a plain .js source file which you can easily view and edit. You can run the examples by just double clicking its .html file.

However, as these examples are not V-IDE projects, they cannot contain any images. Also, only applications which were already created on the Visual Graphics backend can actually communicate to its Database.

To load any of these examples into V-IDE, simply right-click inside the Code Editor of V-IDE and select "Insert Text..." and select the .js source file of the example.

There are some more complex examples in the apps folder (like the AddressBook) which are V-IDE projects and habe to be opened from within V-IDE.
