Visual Graphics JS
==================

Visual Graphics is an Open Source Application Framework written entirely in JavaScript and WebGL. It's main goal is to be able to create complex applications which can compete with native desktop implementations in 'look and feel' and performance.

It combines the best of the HMTL5 2D canvas and WebGL in an easy to use API.

Main Features:

* A lightweight MVC system with integrated Undo / Redo and Load / Save capabilities.
* Many different layouts and widgets.
* WebGL abstraction classes.
* An integrated nodes system. The node application (source code in apps/nodes) can be viewed [here](https://visualgraphics.tv/apps/nodes)

## Developing for Visual Graphics

Makefiles of Visual Graphics applications (they end with .vg) can be compiled into project files (.vide) using a node.js based program called vgmake. vgmake also allows the creation and publishing of applications on the Web.

The documentation of Visual Graphics is currently the weak link and work in progress, you can find the (not complete) documention in the docs folder. We are working on this and hope to have a full documentation as soon as possible. Please also look at the example applications for reference.

V-IDE, the Visual Graphics IDE, has not yet catched up with the latest developments and has temporarily been taken out of the distribution. You can use vgmake to fully replace V-IDE for now.

## Status

The current version is v0.4x with new features being implemented daily. Visual Graphics is already in a usable state, however APIs can change without notice and documentation is quite minimal at the moment.

For more information please visit the Visual Graphics Homepage at http://www.visualgraphics.tv or contact me at markusm@visualgraphics.tv.

# Developing for Visual Graphics

These tools are located inside the nodejs folder.

## vgmake.js

vgmake is an node.js based script to compile a Visual Graphics makefile (.vg) into .vide project which can than be executed via the supplied .html files and published on the Web.

The syntax of vgmake is pretty easy, you just supply the path and name of the .vg file and it will compile it and save it as a .vide file in the same directory as the source .vg file, e.g. "node vgmake.js ../examples/cornellbox/cornellbox.vg". The .html file will read the .vide file and launch it via the supplied visualgraphics.js script.

Additionally you can supply parameters to vgmake to create and publish an application on the Web, this is done by supplying your www.visualgraphics.tv account username and password via the -u and -p parameters and by using additional -create and -update parameters. The syntax of .vg files is described below.

## vgbuild.js

This script builds vglib.min.js from the Visual Graphics sources and should only be used when you are actively developing Visual Graphics or need to insert debug info.

vgbuild.js uses the Google Closure Compiler to compress the Visual Graphics sources. As this can take quite some time, vgbuild supports an -quick option which creates an uncompressed vglib.min.js file. Useful for Visual Graphics development.

### Parameters


* _name_ - Sets the name of the Application. Has to be defined when you want to create the application on the Visual Graphics server.
* _url_ - Sets the Url the application will be available at inside the visualgraphics.tv/apps/ directory once published. Has to be defined when you want to create the application on the Visual Graphics server.
* _version_ - Sets the version string of the application.
* _author_ - Sets the author name of the application.
* _domain_ - Specifies an optional custom domain.
* _keywords_ - Keywords describing application functionality, will be inserted into the applications website meta-data once published.
* _title_ - Title of the application. Will be displayed in the browsers title bar once published.
* _description_ - Multi line description of the application.
* _webBorderColor_ - Specifies a custom web border color in CSS terms.

### Content

* _sources_ - A comma separated list with links to the sources of the application. Several _sources_ lines can be specified.
* _images_ - A comma separated list with links to the images used by the application. Several _images_ lines can be specified. An image can be requested inside an application with VG.Utils.getImageByName( Filename ).
* _html_ - A comma separated list with links to the html or text files used by the application. Several _html_ lines can be specified. An html/text file can be requested inside an application with VG.Utils.getTextByName( Filename ). Filename has to be the basename without any endings.
* _svg_ - A comma separated list with links to the scalable vector files of the application. Several vector file lines can be specified. An SVG can be requested inside an application with VG.Utils.getSVGByName( Filename ).

### An example .vg makefile:

```
name = Website
version = 0.31
url = website
author = Markus Moenig

sources = main.js
sources = homepage.js, newspage.js

images = images/banner.png, images/logo_home.png

svg = svg/glyphs.svg, svg/socialglyphs.svg

html = html/About Visual Graphics.html, html/Features Overview.html
```
