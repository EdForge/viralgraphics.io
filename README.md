Visual Graphics
===============
 
Visual Graphics is an Open Source, Cross-Platform Application and Game Framework written completely in Javascript and WebGL / OpenGL to achieve complete platform independence and maximum graphics performance. It is released under the MIT License.

It is aimed at both application as well as game developers.

Developers can choose from a wide collection of various Layouts and Widgets to create professional applications for every platform including the Web, all based on one source code. As Visual Graphics is drawing all Widgets itself using Styles and Skins, it can completely control it's own look and feel for every platform it is running on. For example the Visual Graphics Website is actually not a Website, but an Visual Graphics application utilizing WebGL. 

VGMAKE is the make utility and VIDE is the Integrated Development Environment for Visual Graphics, both allow direct deployment of apps to the Web and into the up-coming Visual Graphics App Store (and every other platform specific App Store). Native Desktop and Mobile versions for each Visual Graphics application can be can be automatically on Deployment and made available for Download. 

##How it Works

At the core of  Visual Graphics is an OpenGL ES 2 abstraction layer. On the Web this layer is implemented in WebGL, on the Desktop and Mobile platform this layer is implemented in native C++ code.  Visual Graphics itself runs entirely in Javascript with various support functions, like native file requesters or camera access, provided by the host environment. This OpenGL abstraction layer is used to render the Widgets of the User Interface library of  Visual Graphics as well as to create realtime 2D and 3D graphics. 

On Desktop and Mobile platforms Visual Graphics uses either Google V8 or the SpiderMonkey Javascript Engine. 

##The Vision

Creating a high performance Application Platform which enables the developer to easily create Apps and Games of any complexity for every Platform (Web, Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android) based on a single source code. Being able to develop inside an integrated development environment which deploys automatically to the Web and every App Store. 
Support the App with Backend User Management, Database Access and Cloud Storage. Creating a Visual Graphics App Store for both Free and Commercial Applications and Games which is not tied to any specific platform.

##Status

The current version is v0.30 with new features being implemented daily.  Visual Graphics is already in a usable state, however APIs can change without notice and documentation is quite minimal at the moment.
